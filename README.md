# Lead Scoring Case Study

X Education, an online course provider, is seeking to improve its lead conversion rate. Despite generating a significant number of leads through various marketing channels, only about 30% of these leads convert into paying customers.

To enhance efficiency, X Education aims to identify 'Hot Leads' - leads with a high likelihood of conversion. By focusing their sales efforts on these potential leads, they hope to increase their conversion rate.

The dataset has around 9000 past leads, containing various attributes that may influence conversion. The 'Converted' column indicates whether a lead was converted (1) or not (0). To use these data points, I handled levels in categorical variables, particularly the 'Select' level, which is equivalent to a null value.

The goal is to build a logistic regression model to assign lead scores and address additional problems as the company's requirements evolve. This model should be flexible enough to adapt to future changes in the company's needs. I have built a model that assigns a lead score to each lead, indicating their conversion potential. A higher score signifies a 'hotter' lead with a higher chance of conversion. The CEO's target conversion rate is around 80%.
